    <h4>Aldente pasta noodles topped with a tomato based meat sauce.</h4>

    <p>
        I find the versitility of pasta to be one of its best attributes. It can be prepared in such a variety of ways. 
        It is similar to rice in that respect. Both are starches as well. This specific pasta dish
        will consist of spaghetti noodles with a tomato based meat sauce. It'sa spicy meatbol ;o
    </p>
    <p>
        This dish is heavy and will put some meat on your bones so be careful if you're watching your weight.
        Great recipe for getting swoled up though.
